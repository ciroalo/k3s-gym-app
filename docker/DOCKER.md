# Docker 


## Install Docker

First things first, we need to have docker installed in the computer. If you don't have it installed it before hand, you will need to follow the next commands.  

### Uninstall conflicting packages

```bash
for pkg in docker.io docker-doc docker-compose podman-docker containerd runc; do sudo apt-get remove $pkg; done
```


### Set up the repository
Update the apt package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:  
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg
```

Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:  
```bash
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```

Use the following command to set up the repository:
```bash
echo \
  "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

Update the apt package index:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
```


### Install Docker Engine

To install the latest version run:  
```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

Verify that the Docker Engine installation is successful by running the hello-world image.

```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```

This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints a confirmation message and exits.

With this we will have succesfully installe docker.

## Run Docker without sudo
If you don't want to preface the `docker` command with sudo, create a Unix group called `docker` and add users to it. When the Docker Daemon starts, it creates a Unix sock accesible by members of the `docker` group. On some Linux distributions, the system automatically does it for you. In that case there's no need for you to manually create the group.

To create the `docker` group and add your user:
1. Create the docker group:
```bash
sudo groupadd docker
```

2. Add your user to the `docker` group:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

3. Log out and log back in for changes to be instated or run the following command:
```bash
newgrp docker
```

4. Verify that is working with the following command from before:
```bash
docker run hello-world
```
