# Contributing Guidelines

## Basic guidelines

All packages you commit or submit by pull-request should follow these simple
guidelines:

- Package a version which is still maintained by the upstream author and will
  be updated regularly with supported versions.
- When we create the test environment in the homelab, it will need to pass the
  tests to be able to merge into main.
  
### Commits in your pull-requests should

- Have a useful description 
- Include Signed-off-by tag in the commit comments. (E.g.:
  Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>)
  
## Advice on pull requests

Pull requests are the easiest way to contribute changes to git repos at Github.
They are the preferred contribution method, as they offer a nice way for
commenting and amending the proposed changes.

- You need a local "fork" of the Github repo.

- Use a "feature branch" for your changes. That separates the changes in the
  pull request from your other changes and makes it easy to edit/amend commits
  in the pull request. Workflow using "feature_x" as the example:
  - Update your local git fork to the tip (of the master, usually)
  - Create the feature branch with `git checkout -b feature_x`
  - Edit changes and commit them locally
  - Push them to your Github fork by `git push -u origin feature_x`. That
    creates the "feature_x" branch at your Github fork and sets it as the
    remote of this branch
  - When you now visit Github, you should see a proposal to create a pull
    request

- If you later need to add new commits to the pull request, you can simply
  commit the changes to the local branch and then use `git push` to
  automatically update the pull request.

- If you need to change something in the existing pull request (e.g. to add a
  missing signed-off-by line to the commit message), you can use `git push -f`
  to overwrite the original commits. That is easy and safe when using a feature
  branch. Example workflow:
  - Checkout the feature branch by `git checkout feature_x`
  - Edit changes and commit them locally. If you are just updating the commit
    message in the last commit, you can use `git commit --amend` to do that
  - If you added several new commits or made other changes that require
    cleaning up, you can use `git rebase -i HEAD~X` (X = number of commits to
    edit) to possibly squash some commits
  - Push the changed commits to Github with `git push -f` to overwrite the
    original commits in the "feature_x" branch with the new ones. The pull
    request gets automatically updated

## If you have commit access

- Do NOT use git push --force.
- Do NOT commit to other maintainer's packages without their consent.
- Use Pull Requests if you are unsure and to suggest changes to other
  maintainers.
